 ## Description

Do you like to travel? Have you always wanted to travel but don't know which destinations are worth visiting first? With limited time and money the last thing you want to do is waste it on a bad vacation. Enter Jetsettr: a social blog for travellers, by travellers. It's like Tripadvisor, Facebook, and Instagram had a baby. Read posts from other people on their experience with specific locations, giving YOU an opportunity to make an informed decision about where to set your jet to next.

- What was our motivation?

Travelling shouldn't be stressful, and the last thing you want is to spend all your time planning a trip only for it to be a flop! Jetsettr allows travellers to make an informed decision about where to travel based on the experiences of others.

- What problem does it solve?

Never waste your time on a bad trip ever again.

- What did we learn?

This project overall was a learning experience with Git, React, and connecting databases. Also, making a user friendly interface that is easy on the eyes.

- What makes our app different from others?

Jetsettr is travel focused, unlike Facebook and Instagram which are general in their content. Don't be distracted by the fluff! Use Jetsettr and find out what you want to know about where you want to go from people like you.

- Some challenges we faced were:

Some of the biggest challenges building this application were reconciling Git branches so that everyone was on the same page. A couple other problems were obscure Git and ApolloServer connection errors.
